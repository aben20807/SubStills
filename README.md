## Development

### Prerequisites

- Google Chrome browser
- Basic knowledge of Chrome Extension development

### Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Make your changes
3. Reload the extension in `chrome://extensions/`

### Building

No build step required - this is a vanilla JavaScript extension.

## How It Works

1. **Video Detection**: The content script finds the largest playing video on the page
2. **Frame Capture**: Uses HTML5 Canvas API to draw the current video frame
3. **Subtitle Capture**: 
   - Captures native text tracks (WebVTT)
   - Captures DOM-based subtitles (YouTube, Netflix custom players)
4. **Export**: Converts canvas to image data URL for download/clipboard

## Troubleshooting


### Subtitles not captured

- Make sure subtitles are enabled and visible on the video

- This extension was developed with substantial assistance from GitHub Copilot (Claude Opus 4.5, Gemini 3 Pro) and refined through human feedback.
